		<h1> This website is currently under construction </h1>
		<p> This website is currently under construction, please stay patient.</p>
		<p><b> What is the purpose of the future website? </b> <br/>
		Originally I planned to use this website as my personal blog. But I right now it is developing it towards a mix between a portfolio, web-store and a blog.<br/>
		<b> Where can I keep track of how far it has been developed?</b><br/> You can go to my github (<a href="https://github.com/givemeurcookies">Givemeurcookies</a>) for <a href="https://github.com/Givemeurcookies/">the code</a> and there is also one with <a href="http://givemeurcookies.github.com/Readmecookie">the design.</a><br/>
		<b> How long do you think it will take to develop?</b><br/>
		I am a student, so my time is limited, I code whenever I have time and don't have to focus too much on my studies. The development quickly shot up to begin with, but currently I believe there will be small updates once in a while that slowly forms the website into it's shape. I have planned to write the framework in Python with Django, originally the framework was written in PHP but after a lot of thought - PHP sucks.</p>
